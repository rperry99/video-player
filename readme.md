## My Enhancements

- When a user mutes the video then unmutes, the icon will show at full volume no matter what. So if the user had it set to a very low volume, clicks mute, then clicks to unmute, the volume will still be at the low volume, but the icon will be the full volume icon. _I made the change where the icon will match whatever the user had the volume set to._
